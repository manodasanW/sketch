======

This is a simplified version of K-Sketch (www.k-sketch.org) developed for a CS 349 Assignment.

### How to run

#### Desktop

1. cd sketch/Desktop
2. make run

#### Android

1. Install the APK file located in sketch/Android/APK
2. Run the AndroidViewer app

#### Features

* Draw objects by selecting the pencil to draw
* Make your objects colourful by changing the drawing colour by selecting a colour from the colour spinner before drawing
* Animate your objects by selecting the lasso tool and selecting the area to animate and then dragging them around to perform your animation
* Switch between scale and translation animations by selecting/unselecting the scale
* Insert animations in the middle of existing animations by performing animations while the plus is selected at the location to be inserted
* View your created animations by selecting play and go back to the start by selecting stop
* Save your animations and view them on Android by copying over the saved data file to /mnt/sdcard on Android

Note: The Android app may not display animations on most Android devices using Intel processors.  This is a known issue and will be fixed sometime in the future when I have time.
